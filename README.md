# CardGame
CardGame Android App
Simple cardgame, Aces Up. 
[AcesUp.pdf](https://github.com/sumpen99/CardGame/files/10033124/AcesUp.pdf)

To reach winnerscreen without the need to play the whole game change
line 444 in MainActivity.kt from -> if(gameBoard.detectWinner()) to if(!gameBoard.detectWinner()) 
Now you only haft to remove one card to win

This public repo is missing the login-credentials to the server but the app still works.
The difference is instead of send/get data you receive a message pointing that out.
For full access, message me I and send them to you.
